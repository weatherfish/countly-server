## What's Countly?
[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile & [web analytics](http://count.ly/web-analytics), [rich push notifications](http://count.ly/push-notifications) and [crash reporting](http://count.ly/crash-reports) platform powering more than 2500 web sites and 12000 mobile applications. It collects data from mobile phones, tablets, Apple Watch and other internet-connected devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. 

With the help of [Javascript SDK](http://github.com/countly/countly-sdk-web), Countly is a web analytics platform with features on par with mobile SDKs. For more information about web analytics capabilities, [see this link](http://count.ly/web-analytics).

There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and an SDK (mobile, web or desktop) that sends this data. This repository includes Countly Community Edition (server side). For more information other versions (e.g Enterprise Edition), see [comparison of different Countly editions](https://count.ly/compare)

## What makes Countly unique? 

Countly is a privacy-focused and 360-degree analytics approach with several, unique values:

* Real-time mobile analytics, web analytics and push notifications.
* Your data, your rules - since you can install Countly on your own server, or let us do the private cloud installations for you.
* Configurable and extensible via open source [plugins](http://count.ly/plugins).
* Modern and easy to use web dashboard with a focus on user experience, helping to get complex insights easily.
* Tracking more than 2500 web sites and 12000 mobile applications.
* Collecting more than 60 billion datapoints worlwide.

## Differences between Community Edition & Enterprise Edition

* **Audience:** Community Edition is for product managers, developers and analytics enthusiasts, whereas banks, operators, healthcare companies and businesses that run the world's leading websites choose Enterprise Edition.
* **Deployment:** Community Edition deployments are for environments where the information stored is not critical since it does not include professional assistance. You must have a qualified technician. Enterprise Edition is for corporate environments that require availability and reliability where intellectual capital is critical.
* **Technology:** Community Edition has a number of limitations, including no corporate support for sharding, replica sets or installation.
* **Guarantee:** Community Edition is on the bleeding edge regarding version upgrades and with no bugfix guarantee. Enterprise Edition has bugfix guarantee, immediate resolution, verified builds, on-site and automatic version upgrades.
* **Features:** Enterprise Edition has more features compared to Countly, with a focus on end-to-end analytics and marketing platform.

## Installing & upgrading Countly server

We develop and test Countly on MongoDB, Node.js and Nginx. Installation script only needs a clean, decent Ubuntu/CentOS/RHEL Linux without any services listening to port 80 or 443 (which should also be not blocked), and takes care of every library and software required to be installed on Linux. 

There are several ways to install Countly: 

1. The following command will download and install Countly on your **Ubuntu** or **CentOS** server. 

    `wget -qO- http://c.ly/install | bash`

2. If you have a Digital Ocean account, [click here and install on Digital Ocean](http://do.count.ly) with a single click.

3. For bash lovers, we provide a beautiful installation script (`bin/countly.install.sh`) in countly-server package which installs everything required to run Countly Server. For this, you need a stable release of this repository [available here](https://github.com/Countly/countly-server/releases). 

4. Countly also has Docker support - [see our official Docker repository](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/countly/countly-server/) and [installation instructions for Docker](http://resources.count.ly/docs/installing-countly-server)

If you want to upgrade Countly from a previous version, please take a look at [upgrading documentation](resources.count.ly/v1.0/docs/upgrading-countly-server).

## API & Frontend

Countly has a [well defined API](http://resources.count.ly), that reads from or writes to Node.js. Dashboard is built using this API, so it's possible to fetch any kind of information from Node process directly using Countly API. For those who are interested with building their own dashboard; important files are:

- `frontend/express/app.js`, Countly dashboard that runs on Express server 
- `frontend/express/public/javascripts/countly`, that contains seperate helper js files for each data visualization
- `countly.session.js`, responsible for calculating session related metrics and 
- `api/api.js`, which is Countly write and read API. 

## Extensibility & plugins 

Countly is extensible with [plugins](http://count.ly/plugins). We suggest [you read this document](http://resources.count.ly/docs/plugins-development-introduction) and start writing your plugin. We support companies with know-how in need to write their own plugins.

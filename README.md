##What's Countly?
[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile & [web analytics](http://count.ly/web-analytics), [push notifications](http://count.ly/push-notifications) and [crash reporting](http://count.ly/crash-reports) platform powering nearly 3000 mobile applications. It collects data from mobile phones, tablets, Apple Watch and other internet-connected devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. 

With the help of [Javascript SDK](http://github.com/countly/countly-sdk-web), Countly is a web analytics platform with features on par with mobile SDKs. For more information about web analytics capabilities, [see this link](http://count.ly/web-analytics).

There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and an SDK (mobile, web or desktop) that sends this data. This repository includes Countly Community Edition (server side). For more information other versions (e.g Enterprise Edition), see [comparison of different Countly editions](https://count.ly/compare)

##Installing & upgrading Countly server

We develop and test Countly on MongoDB, Node.js and Nginx. Installation script only needs a clean, decent Ubuntu/CentOS/RHEL Linux without any services listening to port 80 or 443 (which should also be not blocked), and takes care of every library and software required to be installed on Linux. 

There are several ways to install Countly: 

1. The following command will download and install Countly on your **Ubuntu** or **CentOS** server. 

    wget -qO- http://c.ly/install | bash

2. If you have a Digital Ocean account, [click here and install on Digital Ocean](http://do.count.ly) with a single click.

3. For bash lovers, we provide a beautiful installation script (`bin/countly.install.sh`) in countly-server package which installs everything required to run Countly Server. For this, you need a stable release of this repository [available here](https://github.com/Countly/countly-server/releases). 

4. Countly also has Docker support - [see our official Docker repository](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/countly/countly-server/) and [installation instructions for Docker](http://resources.count.ly/docs/installing-countly-server)

If you want to upgrade Countly from a previous version, please take a look at [upgrading documentation](resources.count.ly/v1.0/docs/upgrading-countly-server).

##API & Frontend

Countly has a [well defined API](http://resources.count.ly), that reads from or writes to Node.js. Dashboard is built using this API, so it's possible to fetch any kind of information from Node process directly using Countly API. For those who are interested with building their own dashboard; important files are:

- `frontend/express/app.js`, Countly dashboard that runs on Express server 
- `frontend/express/public/javascripts/countly`, that contains seperate helper js files for each data visualization
- `countly.session.js`, responsible for calculating session related metrics and 
- `api/api.js`, which is Countly write and read API. 

##Extensibility & plugins 

Countly is extensible with [plugins](http://count.ly/plugins). We suggest [you read this document](http://resources.count.ly/docs/plugins-development-introduction) and start writing your plugin. We support companies with know-how in need to write their own plugins.
